Dynamic Shielding (Python)
==========================

This is the root directory of our python codes for dynamic shielding.

We remark that our java code must be compiled before runnig the python code. 

Directories
-----------

Our python codes consist of the following directories.

- `src/`: the main code for (dynamic) shielding
- `benchmarks/`: the benchmarks we used in our experiments
- `test/`: the unit test
